Appliance Configuration
#######################

This module contains documentation for system level configuration applicable for Appliance (VM) based Verify Identity 
Access deployments. Container configuration is defined under the ``container`` top level key. At a minimum an administrator
should define the ``isva_base_url``, ``isva_admin_user`` and ``isva_admin_password`` keys (or define the applicable
environment variables).

.. _appliance:

Appliance specific configuration
================================
This section covers the configuration options which are only available on appliance or Virtual Machine deployments of 
Verify Identity Access.


.. include:: base.rst



FIPS Compliance
===============
Verify Identity Access can be configured to FIPS compliance when required. FIPS compliance can only be enabled on new (unconfigured) 
appliances and should be enabled before any other configuration options are applied.


.. autoclass::  src.ibmvia_autoconf.configure.IVIA_Configurator.FIPS
   :members:


.. _appliance-networking:

Networking
==========
The networking settings can be used to define networking routes, as well as interface address, netmask and gateway 
setting on a Verify Identity Access appliance. This configuration is also able to add hostfile entries as well as setting the
hostname of Verify Identity Access. Care must be taken when configuring network interfaces to ensure that the 
interface used to configure the appliance is not changed (as this will result in the automation tool failing).

    .. note:: Interfaces can only be updated using the LMI, they cannot be created.

.. _appliance-date-time:

Date / Time settings
====================
The date and time settings can be adjusted on a Verify Identity Access appliance or synchronized to a external NTP server. Admins 
are also able to set the time zone of the appliance using canonical name.

To set the Date/Time configuration using either a NTP server or manually setting the date via a formatted string. A 
complete list of the available configuration properties can be found `here <https://lachlan-ibm.github.io/pyivia>`_. 
An example configuration is:


.. autoclass::  src.ibmvia_autoconf.appliance.Appliance_Configurator.Date_Time
   :members:


.. _cluster-configuration:

Cluster Configuration
=====================
The cluster configuration options can be used to add additional servers to the Verify Identity Identity Access deployment. Currently only
 external databases (HVDB and config) as well as Verify Identity Identity Access HA servers are supported.

This option is typically used in a container deployment to configure the HVDB connection. A complete list of the available 
configuration properties can be found :ref:`here <pyivia:systemsettings#cluster>`. 

    .. note:: PKI required to connect to any servers should be imported in the previous step.

.. _managed-containers:

Managed Containers
==================
The managed containers properties allows administrators to deploy IBM containerize products to IBM Verify Identity
Access appliances. This is particularly useful for administrators with hardware based appliances, allowing them to
deploy a greater range of IBM products with their existing hardware.

.. _global-configuration:

Global Configuration
====================
These configuration properties are common to the Access Control and Federation modules. You must have at least one of 
these modules activated in order to set these configuration properties.
