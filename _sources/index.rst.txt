Welcome to ibmvia-autoconf documentation!
==================================================
ibmvia-autoconf is an automation layer written on top of pyIVIA. This library should be used to apply 
YAML configuration files to a Verify Identity Access deployment.

This library is designed to work with both Appliance and Container based deployments, and is not idempotent.

Configuration is supplied in YAML syntax using a well-defined data structure (detailed in this doc).


Installation
------------
You can install ``ibmvia-autoconf`` with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install ibmvia-autoconf

.. _ibmvia_autoconf_architecture:

Architecture
------------

Users should take care to ensure the configuration of these separate features are compatible (eg. conflicting ALC's
in a WebSEAL reverse proxy). Administrators will also have to define the ``webseal.runtime`` entry for many configuration
options even if the :ref:`WebSEAL Runtime Component<webseal_runtime_server>` is already configured.

Example configurations can be found in the ``examples`` directory with additional documentation in the 
`Examples / Getting Started <examples.html>`_ page.


.. _ibmvia_autoconf_modules:

Modules
_______

The configuration process is broken into six modules. Each module is responsible for configuring a subset of
Verify Identity Access features. The order of configuration is:

- base (Licensing, SSL Databases, Cluster Settings)
- appliance (if applicable)
- container (if applicable)
- webseal
- access control
- federations

More complex deployment architectures can be achieved by running sequential ``config.yaml`` descriptors.

.. _ibmvia_autoconf_yaml_keywords:

YAML configuration keywords
___________________________

Each module expects a YAML object describing the desired configuration state. There are a number of useful features 
which can be used to make configuration files re-usable and version controlled. There are three keywords which 
can be used in configuration files:

 - ``!include``
    Used to include a YAML configuration file as the value of the given key. This file can be either an 
    absolute path or relative to the ``IVIA_CONFIG_BASE`` environment variable. eg::

                                                                                    container: !include base_config.yaml
                                                                                    webseal: !include webseal.yaml
                                                                                    access_control: !include aac.yaml

 - ``!secret``
    Used to set the value of the given key as a value read from the given Kubernetes Secret Namespace/Name,
    eg::

        admin_password: !secret default/isva-secrets:admin_secret

 - ``!environment``: 
    Used to set the value of the given key as the value read from the given environment variable,
    eg::

        admin_password: !environment IVIA_ADMIN_SECRET


.. _ibmvia_autoconf_env_vars:

Environment properties
______________________

In addition to the supplied YAML configuration, some properties can alternatively be set as environment variables. If
these variables are set, they take priority over values set in configuration files.

- ``IVIA_CONFIG_BASE``
                        This variable is the root directory of all configuration files for the given Verify Identity Access 
                        Deployment. This can include: YAML configuration files; HTML template pages; JavaScript mapping
                        rules; XML configuration files.
                        
                        .. note:: If this environment variable is not set then the user's ``$HOME`` directory is used.

- ``IVIA_CONFIG_YAML``
                        This variable defines the YAML configuration file to deploy. This can be either relative
                        to the ``IVIA_CONFIG_BASE`` directory or an absolute file path. If this variable is not defined 
                        then the configuration will look for a file called ``config.yaml`` in the ``IVIA_CONFIG_BASE``
                        directory.

- ``IVIA_MGMT_BASE_URL``
                        This variable is the URL address that Verify Identity Access Local Management Interface is responding 
                        on. This should contain: the https scheme; the domain or IP address; and a port if not the 
                        standard (443) port. eg: ``https://127.0.0.2:9443``.

- ``IVIA_MGMT_USER``
                        The user to perform configuration as. This user should have sufficient permissions to configure 
                        all of the features in your YAML configuration file.

- ``IVIA_MGMT_PWD``
                        The password required to authenticate as the user defined by ``IVIA_MGMT_USER``.

- ``IVIA_MGMT_OLD_PWD``
                        If a password change is required then this variable defines the password for ``IVIA_MGMT_USER``
                        before the configuration is applied.

- ``IVIA_KUBERNETES_YAML_CONFIG``
                        This variable defines the Kubernetes cluster configuration file required to run ``kubectl``
                        commands. This configuration file should have sufficient permission in your cluster to restart 
                        deployments and pods in the namespace that Verify Identity Access is deployed to.
                        The file path can either be absolute or relative to the ``IVIA_CONFIG_BASE`` variable.

                        .. note:: This is only applicable for Container deployments using Kubernetes orchestration.

- ``IVIA_DOCKER_COMPOSE_CONFIG``
                        This variable defines the Docker-Compose deployment configuration file required to run
                        ``docker-compose`` commands for your Verify Identity Access deployment. This file path can 
                        either be absolute or relative to the ``IVIA_CONFIG_BASE`` variable.

                        .. note:: This is only applicable for Container deployments using Docker-Compose orchestration.

- ``IVIA_CONFIGURATOR_LOG_LEVEL``
                        This variable set the logging level for the autoconf tool. The default log level is ``INFO``.
